Calliope
========

Calliope is a mature music score notation editor written by Professor William Clocksin in
1993 that originally ran on NeXTStep machines and has since been ported to OpenStep
systems such as Windows and Rhapsody (using the Yellow Box API). It is currently in the
process of porting to MacOS X using the Cocoa API and subsequently Linux using GnuStep. It
is written in Objective C and links against the open source MusicKit/SndKit API also hosted on
GitHub.com. Calliope offers good support for typesetting modern and early musical
scores, including lyrics and lute tablature. Making the source code open is intended to
complete the porting and modernise the file format support as well as for incorporating
users bug reports and fixes.
