Using FontForge, Calliope.dfont (The MacOS X name for OpenType fonts) has been
created from the original Postscript font specified by Calliope.pfa and Calliope.afm
(which were originally saved in a Calliope.font directory). The FontForge source file which
combines the metrics and the outlines is Calliope.sfd.
